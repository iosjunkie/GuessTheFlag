###### DayOneSwiftUI
### Guess the flag
The first project of 100 days of Swiftui. It is called Guess the flag

#### What I learned
- Creating an array of string by simply adding `.components(separatedBy: " ")` to a string
- Learned how to use modifiers
  - .renderingMode
  - .overlay
    - allows us to create borders
  - .shadow
  - .foregroundColor - changes text color
  - .edgesIgnoringSafeArea
- Use of alert inside `body`
- ForEach is a view that is an exception to the 10 children limit rule
- ZStack puts a view on top of each other
- `.shuffled()` shuffles an array
- Use of animation to rotate and fade
  - Grabbed some animation ideas from CypherPoet's github
